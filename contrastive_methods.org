#+title: Contrastive Methods

Contrastive methods learn representations by contrasting positive and negative
examples. This is one of methods used in {[Self-supervised Learning]}.

The goal is to learn an encoder $f$ such that:

\begin{equation}
  \text{score}(f(x), f(x^{+})) >> \text{score}(f(x), f(x^{-}))
\end{equation}

where $x^{+}$ is a positive example, and $x^{-}$ is a negative example.
