*** Evaluating Grasp Contact Points
The first category of methods sample candidate grasp contact points, and use
analytical methods or deep learning methods to evaluate the quality of the
grasp. This relies on prior knowledge such as object geometry and physics
models. {{grasp_estimation.org::20}{mahler_dex-net_2017: Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics}} uses deep learning
methods to plan grasps.
