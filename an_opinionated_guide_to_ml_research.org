- The keys to success are *working on the right problems, making
  continual progress on them, and achieving continual personal
  growth.* This essay is comprised of three sections, each covering
  one of these topics.

* Choosing Problems

Develop good taste for what problems to work on.

1. Read a lot of papers, and *assess them critically*.
2. Work in a research group with other people working on similar topics.
3. Seek advice from experienced researchers on what to work on.
4. Reflect on what research is useful;
   1. When is theory useful?
   2. What causes some ideas to get wide uptake?

** Idea-Driven vs Goal-Driven Research

- Idea driven :: follow some sector of literature, and improve on
  existing ideas.
  - Cons :: High risk of getting snooped, or duplicating work,
    requires deep understanding of subject

- Goal-driven :: Have vision of new AI capabilities, and experiment
  with diferent methods across the literature. Develop your own
  methods to improve on them.
  - Pros :: much more motivating. goals also give differentiating
    perspective from rest of the community.

{[John Schulman]} recommends goal-driven research.

** Tips for Goal-Driven research

1. Don't take the goal too literally. *Restrict yourself to general
   solutions.*
2. Aim high, and climb incrementally towards high goals
   1. Keep a notebook, and record daily ideas and experiments
      ({[Note-taking]}). {[John Schulman]} creates an entry for each day, and
      conducts a review to condense entries every 1 or 2 weeks.
3. Know when to switch problems. Also, don't switch problems too
   often. Notice the dead-ends in half-finished projects, and if there
   aren't any, make a commitment towards following through in the
   future.
4. Have a fixed time budget for trying out new ideas that diverge from
   the main line of work.

* Personal Development

- Read textbooks, theses and papers, reimplement algorithms from these
  sources. Especially textbooks, because they condense information in
  an ordered fashion, and using proper notation!
- Theses are a good place to find a literature review of an active field.
