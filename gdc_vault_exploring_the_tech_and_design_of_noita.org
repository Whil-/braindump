Noita uses a very simple falling sand simulation algorithm, liquids and gases are implemented similarly.

Rigid bodies use a marching square algorithm.

How to simulate all pixels in a big world? Multi-threading! The world is divided into $64 \times 64$ chunks. Each chunk keeps a dirty rectangle, containing all the pixels that need to be simulated.
