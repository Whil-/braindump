#+title: Slice Sampling

Slice sampling has similarities to {[Gibbs Sampling]}, {[Rejection Sampling]}
and the {[Metropolis-Hastings Method]}. The advantage over simple
{[Metropolis-Hastings Method]} methods is that it is robust to the choice of
parameters. Like rejection sampling, it asymptotically draws samples
from volume under the curve $p^\star(x)$.

A good treatment of slice sampling can be found in Mackay's Book
[[http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf][Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms]].
