#+title: Non-parametric Filters

- tags :: {[Bayes Filter]}, {[Particle Filter]}, {[Histogram Filter]}

Non-parametric filters do not make strong assumptions on the posterior
density, making them well suited for complex, multi-modal beliefs. The
representational power comes at the cost of computational complexity.

Some non-parametric techniques allow adaptivity. For example, particle filters
can adapt the number of particles based on the available compute resources.
