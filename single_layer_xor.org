* Finding

The way the biological human neuron implements XOR is by a formerly
unknown type of local response to inputs, which is low below the
threshold, maximal at the threshold and decreases as the input
intensifies above the threshold.

* Why is this interesting?

- XOR used to be impossible to compute without inhibitory mechanisms,
  but this is makes that possible.
- Hence the human brain can use a single-layered network to compute
  the XOR function.
