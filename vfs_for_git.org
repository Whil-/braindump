#+title: VFS for Git

VFS for {[Git]} is a virtualized filesystem used to bypass assumptions
about repository size, allowing Git repositories to scale up to large
repositories.

With GVFS, an initial clone downloads a set of pack-files containing
only commits and trees. These objects are sufficient for generating a
view of the working directory, and examining the commit history with
git log.

GVFS allows dynamically downloading objects as needed.

Git has trouble handling large repositories. This problem is resolved
using {{git_scalar.org::10}{VFS for Git}}. This is essentially a wrapper around GVFS,
replacing the =git= command.

*** 2. Reducing Object Transfer
The {{git_scalar.org::29}{VFS for Git}} protocol reduces object transfer.
